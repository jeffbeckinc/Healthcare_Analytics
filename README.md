#  🩺🏥 Healthcare Analytics & Visualization Project *(In Progress)*
> 🚧 *Current phase: Data Exploration (SQL + Power BI)*

This project explores a multi-source dataset representing global child mortality rates and healthcare expenditures, using SQL, Python, and Power BI to uncover data-driven insights. It simulates real-world reporting demands in logistics, public health, and compliance monitoring.

## 📁 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate:
- SQL proficiency for data exploration, transformation, and statistical analysis
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, plotnine) for data wrangling and custom visualizations
- Power BI for designing dynamic, user-friendly dashboards that support strategic decision-making

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **SQL Server**: complex queries, ranking, statistical filters, formatted outputs
- **Python**: pandas, matplotlib, plotnine for analysis and visual storytelling
- **Power BI**: data modeling, KPIs, custom visuals, user-centric dashboarding
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub for project history and collaboration

## 📊 Key Skills Demonstrated
- Use of `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, and statistical filters (e.g. outliers via standard deviation)
- Conversion of `varchar` fields into formatted numeric displays
- Python-based feature engineering and compatibility resolution (e.g., pandas upgrades, matplotlib issues)
- Design of data model and visuals in Power BI for fleet KPIs and compliance readiness
