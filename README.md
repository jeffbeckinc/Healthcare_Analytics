#  🩺🏥 Healthcare Analytics & Visualization Project *(In Progress)*
> 🚧 *Current phase: Data Exploration (SQL + Power BI)*

This project explores a multi-source dataset representing global child mortality rates, life expectancies, GDP spend on healthcare and healthcare expenditures, using SQL, Python, and Power BI to uncover data-driven insights. It simulates real-world reporting demands in  public health and economics 

The original data came from [hrterhrter on Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/programmerrdai/financing-healthcare)

## 📁 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate:
- Reviewing tables of data to bring in most relevant data for creating insightful and interesting visualizations
- SQL proficiency for data exploration, transformation, and statistical analysis
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, plotnine) for data wrangling and custom visualizations
- Power BI for designing dynamic, user-friendly dashboards that support strategic decision-making

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **SQL Server**: subqueries, basic statistics, CASE WHEN statements, updating table and column names, creating stored procedures and formatted outputs
- **Python**: pandas, matplotlib, plotnine for analysis and visual storytelling
- **Power BI**: data modeling, KPIs, custom visuals, user-centric dashboarding
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub for project history and version control

## 📊 Key Skills Demonstrated
- Use of subqueries, and statistical filters (e.g. outliers via standard deviation)
- Conversion of `varchar` fields into formatted numeric displays
- Python-based feature engineering and compatibility resolution (e.g., pandas upgrades, matplotlib issues)
- Design of data model and visuals in Power BI for economic metrics and compliance readiness
